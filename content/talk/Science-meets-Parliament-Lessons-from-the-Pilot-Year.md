summary: The role of science and evidence in policy creation has never been more critical nor more at risk. But when do researchers and decision makers have a chance to connect? How should scientists communicate their knowledge to the Parliamentarians who need it?
abstract: In November 2018, thirty of Canada’s emerging leaders in science and engineering converged on Ottawa to participate in Science meets Parliament – a pilot programme designed to generate and strengthen relationships between researchers working in Canada and federal Parliamentarians in order to reaffirm science and evidence-informed policy as Canadian cultural norms. Capt. McTaggart will tell the first-hand story of Science meets Parliament Canada, from its inspiration and planning stages through to the training workshops and nearly 100 individual meetings between researchers and Parliamentarians
