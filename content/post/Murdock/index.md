I am extremely pleased to announce that Dr. Adrian Murdock and I have been awarded a travel grant by the Royal Society of London to develop new methods for low-power water desalination and water treatment.

Dr. Murdock’s work uses graphene membranes to create channels that separate water from pollutants including salt ions. Given the amount of the world’s population that lives near the coast and the ongoing challenges of providing clean water to urban populations, desalination and purification technologies that leverage nanoscale physics are poised to make an enormous impact on global health. Their latest paper was published in Nature Communications and can be found here (open article).

Our goal will be to incorporate our 2D gold nanosheets into the membrane to induce a thermal gradient and net water flow when exposed to solar radiation. Although a precious metal, the amount of gold present in the nanomaterial will be miniscule and the material costs are certain to be dwarfed by the costs in electricity and filtering agents required for existing desalination and purification systems.
