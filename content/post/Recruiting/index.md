Our lab is looking for new MSc and PhD students! We do:

- [x] Self-assembling nanoreactors (like synthetic enzymes)! 
- [x] The world’s only 2D gold crystals (just 1 atom thick)! 
- [x] Tumor-targeting drug delivery (take that cancer)! 
- [x] Quantum-mechanical modeling (impress your friends)! 
- [x] Windsurfing (Kingston is a glorious city)! 
- [x] International collaborations (US, UK, Australia, and counting)! 
- [ ] New things I can’t talk about yet (but honestly it’s SO WILD and COULD USE YOUR HELP)!

We have an amazing lab with more work than hands, so please spread the word.

Applicants should have a background in Chemistry or Physics or their Bio-variants, Nanoscience/engineering, or related fields.
