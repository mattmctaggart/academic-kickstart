abstract: Confinement has been shown to contribute to the dynamics of small molecules within nanoscale hydrophobic or hydrophilic cavities. Enclosure within a confined space can also influence energy transfer pathways, such as the enhancement of fluorescence over thermal relaxation. In this paper, the effect of confinement on the thermodynamic properties and reaction kinetics of small hydrophobic molecules confined in a soft polymeric template is detailed. A quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment identified a substantial decrease in translational diffusion of pyrrole after solubilization within a hydrophobic cavity. This decrease in mobility is due to pyrroleâ€™s closer packing and increased density under confinement vs the bulk liquid. The decreased mobility and increased density explain the spontaneous polymerization reaction of pyrrole observed within the cavity. The precise characterization of the polymerization kinetics under confinement found that the reaction is independent of pyrrole concentration, consistent with the close packing density. Kinetic data also show that confinement dimensionality finds a thermodynamic expression in the transition state entropy. The dynamics and kinetics experiments reported here offer rare empirical insight into the important influence that cavity geometry places on the reactions they host.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We follow the same pyrrole polymerization reaction under 1D and 2D confinement (occurring within a ~2 nm reaction space) to discover that the difference in entropy between the two geometries increases the reaction favourability and reaction rate.
