abstract: The variety of nanoarchitectures made feasible by the self-assembly of alternating copolymers opens new avenues for biomimicry. Indeed, self-assembled structures allow the development of nanoreactors which combine the efficiency of high surface area metal active centres to the effect of confinement due to the very small cavities generated by the self-assembly process. A novel self-assembly of high molecular weight alternating copolymers is characterized in the present study. The self-assembly is shown to organize into nanosheets, providing a 2 nm hydrophobic cavity with a 1D confinement.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The self-assembly nanosheets, providing a 2 nm hydrophobic cavity with a 1D confinement provide an ideal template for confinement enhanced reactions under hydrophobic environment in aqueous solution.
