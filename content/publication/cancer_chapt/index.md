abstract: The first nanomedicine was approved for clinical use over 20 years ago. In the intervening time, our ability to engineer materials at the nanoscale has advanced immensely, yet a revolution in targeted drug delivery remains elusive. Nowhere is this more keenly felt than in the treatment of multi-drug resistant cancers, where nanotechnology’s fine control over drug release rate, location, and sequence promises a suite of tools for the effective long-term management of disease. This chapter provides a survey of the current knowledge and trajectory of nanomaterial drug delivery systems for avoiding or overcoming multiple drug resistance in cancer treatment. Existing nanocarriers in development incorporate a variety of materials and properties designed to transit through the circulatory system, concentrate at tumor sites, selectively bind to cancerous cells, and release their drug payloads. However, a greater understanding of the biological barriers to achieving each of those steps is still needed for drug delivery systems to successfully translate into clinical treatment. Greater attention on the interactions between specific delivery systems and their specific target cells in vivo might be achieved through a ‘disease-first’ design strategy and closer integration of materials and physiology during training.
