Matt McTaggart is an assistant professor and PhD candidate in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the Royal Military College of Canada. He is developing materials that take inspiration from nanostructured biological systems such as the programmable optics of squid skin or the surprisingly versatile thermodynamics of enzymes.

Matt joined the Canadian Forces in 2001 as an aircraft mechanic and worked on the CP-140 Aurora anti-submarine and reconnaisance platform. Since accepting an offer for Commission in 2009, Matt remustered to Logistics Officer and now specializes in ammunition and explosives. He lives in Kingston with his wife, Danielle, and children Jamie and Moira.
